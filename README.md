* [MAME Tools](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/utils/mame-tools)
* [milliluk-tools](https://github.com/milliluk/milliluk-tools)
* [tlindner/cmoc\_os9](https://github.com/tlindner/cmoc_os9)
* [Java Grinder](http://www.mikekohn.net/micro/java_grinder.php)
* [naken](http://www.mikekohn.net/micro/naken_asm.php)
* [coco-tools 0.3](https://github.com/jamieleecho/coco-tools)
* [tasm6801](https://github.com/gregdionne/tasm6801)
* [mcbasic](https://github.com/gregdionne/mcbasic)
* [mc10-tools 0.2](https://github.com/jamieleecho/mc10-tools)
* Python and Ruby as well as some useful Python packages


## Motivation
This repo is motivated in part by the need to keep the tools in sync
between different computers. Because the Dockerfile contains all of the
dependencies in a single place creating and sharing a reproducible
development environment becomes possible.


## Requirements
* [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra/) or
  [Linux](https://www.debian.org)
* [Docker 17](https://www.docker.com)

On Mac systems you must share `/Users` with Docker. To do this:
* From the Docker menu select `Preferences...`
* Click on the `File Sharing` tab
* Click on `+`
* Select `/Users`
* Click `Apply & Restart`


## Using coco-dev
```
# Start the Docker application if it is not already running
git clone https://github.com/jamieleecho/coco-dev.git
coco-dev/coco-dev
```
This will create a Linux shell in your home directory. You can `cd` into
your target folder and use typical development commands such as `lwasm`,
`lwlink`, `decb`, `os9` and `cmoc`


## Building coco-dev
```
# Start the Docker application if it is not already running
git clone https://github.com/jamieleecho/coco-dev.git
cd coco-dev
./build
```
